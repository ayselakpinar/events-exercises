    3. Make it so that when you type in the input, you
       log out: [INPUT id=ex1]: input_value
       where input_value is the actual text inside
       the input box (on change/input)

/*
    1. Create a new Vite React project

    2. Create a Grades.jsx file that has a component
       that returns a <table /> element

    3. Add three columns to the table: "Subject",
       "Mark" and "Grade" where Subject is a school
       subject (Eg. Math), Mark is a number between
       0-100 and Grade is a letter-grade (Eg: A, B)

    3. Add some table data to this table so you have
       at least 5 rows to fill in the columns

    4. How would you make it so that when you CLICK any
       of the table data cells, it logs out the text inside?
       NOTE: Event delegation is your friend here!

    4. Export this function and replace <App /> in the
       main.jsx file with this imported Grades component

    5. Check in your Browser to see if it works as expected

    Example:

    Subject   |   Mark   |   Grade
    --------------------------------
    Math      |   65     |   C
    Science   |   77     |   B
    Art       |   92     |   A+

/*
    1. Create a new Vite React project

    2. Create a ContactForm.jsx file that has a component
       that returns a <form /> element

    3. Add the following inputs to the form:
       - A text input for "first name"
         Give this a placeholder and name property
       - A text input for "last name"
         Give this a placeholder and name property
       - A number input for "age"
         Give this a placeholder and name property
       - A submit button with type submit

    3. Make it so that on form SUBMISSION, you prevent
       the default form reload behaviour and then you 
       log out the first name, last name and age submitted

    4. Export this function and replace <App /> in the
       main.jsx file with this imported ContactForm component

    5. Check in your Browser to see if it works as expected

    HINT1* How do you prevent event defaults?
    HINT2* You have access to the form element in the event
